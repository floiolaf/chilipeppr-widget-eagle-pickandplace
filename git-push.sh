# In Cloud9 IDE, right-click and choose "Run" on this file to push your changes to 
# Github. The Cloud9 IDE will run this on the virtual machine command line to
# trigger the push to Github. Of course you can manually run these commands too
# if you want to push your changes in a different way to Github.
#
# Alternately, you could run this from the console window that Cloud9 pulls up
# automatically when it loads.
