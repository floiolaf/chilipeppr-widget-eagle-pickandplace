## ChiliPeppr Widget / Template

All ChiliPeppr widgets/elements are defined using cpdefine() which is a method
that mimics require.js. Each defined object must have a unique ID so it does
not conflict with other ChiliPeppr widgets.

| Item                  | Value           |
| -------------         | ------------- | 
| ID                    | com-chilipeppr-widget-template |

## Example Code for chilipeppr.load() Statement

You can use the code below as a starting point for instantiating this widget 
inside a workspace or from another widget. The key is that you need to load 
your widget inlined into a div so the DOM can parse your HTML, CSS, and 
Javascript. Then you use cprequire() to find your widget's Javascript and get 
back the instance of it.

```javascript
chilipeppr.load(
  "#myDivWidgetInsertedInto",
  "http://raw.githubusercontent.com/xpix/chilipeppr-widget-eagle-dispenser/master/auto-generated-widget.html",
  function() {
    // Callback after widget loaded into #myDivWidgetInsertedInto
    cprequire(
      "inline:com-chilipeppr-widget-template", // the id you gave your widget
      function(mywidget) {
        // Callback that is passed reference to your newly loaded widget
        console.log("My widget just got loaded.", mywidget);
        mywidget.init();
      }
    );
  }
);

```

## Publish

This widget/element publishes the following signals. These signals are owned by this widget/element and are published to all objects inside the ChiliPeppr environment that listen to them via the 
chilipeppr.subscribe(signal, callback) method.

| Signal | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| /com-chilipeppr-widget-template/onExampleGenerate | Example: Publish this signal when we go to generate gcode. |

## Subscribe

| Signal | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| (No signals defined in this widget/element) |

## Foreign Subscribe

## Methods / Properties

The table below shows, in order, the methods and properties inside the widget/element.

| Item                  | Type          | Description |
| -------------         | ------------- | ----------- |
| id | string | "com-chilipeppr-widget-template"<br><br>The ID of the widget. You must define this and make it unique. |
| name | string | "Widget / Template" |
| desc | string | "This example widget gives you a framework for creating your own widget. Please change this description once you fork this template and create your own widget." |
| url | string | "http://raw.githubusercontent.com/xpix/chilipeppr-widget-eagle-dispenser/master/auto-generated-widget.html" |

| testurl | string | "http://chilipeppr-eagle-plugandplay-xpix.c9users.io/widget.html" |
| publish | object | Please see docs above.<br><br>Define the publish signals that this widget/element owns or defines so thatother widgets know how to subscribe to them and what they do. |
| subscribe | object | Please see docs above.<br><br>Define the subscribe signals that this widget/element owns or defines so thatother widgets know how to subscribe to them and what they do. |
| foreignPublish | object | Please see docs above.<br><br>Document the foreign publish signals, i.e. signals owned by other widgetsor elements, that this widget/element publishes to. |
| foreignSubscribe | object | Please see docs above.<br><br>Document the foreign subscribe signals, i.e. signals owned by other widgetsor elements, that this widget/element subscribes to. |
| init | function | function () <br><br>All widgets should have an init method. It should be run by theinstantiating code like a workspace or a different widget. |
| btnSetup | function | function () <br><br>Call this method from init to setup all the buttons when this widgetis first loaded. This basically attaches click events to your buttons. It also turns on all the bootstrap popovers by scanningthe entire DOM of the widget. |
| onHelloBtnClick | function | function (evt) <br><br>onHelloBtnClick is an example of a button click event callback |
| options | object | User options are available in this property for reference by yourmethods. If any change is made on these options, please callsaveOptionsLocalStorage() |
| setupUiFromLocalStorage | function | function () <br><br>Call this method on init to setup the UI by reading the user'sstored settings from localStorage and then adjust the UI to reflectwhat the user wants. |
| saveOptionsLocalStorage | function | function () <br><br>When a user changes a value that is stored as an option setting, youshould call this method immediately so that on next load the valueis correctly set. |
| showBody | function | function (evt) <br><br>Show the body of the panel.<br><br><b>evt</b> ({jquery_event})  - If you pass the event parameter in, we know it was clicked by the user and thus we store it for the next load so we can reset the user's preference. If you don't pass this value in we don't store the preference because it was likely code that sent in the param. |
| hideBody | function | function (evt) <br><br>Hide the body of the panel.<br><br><b>evt</b> ({jquery_event})  - If you pass the event parameter in, we know it was clicked by the user and thus we store it for the next load so we can reset the user's preference. If you don't pass this value in we don't store the preference because it was likely code that sent in the param. |
| forkSetup | function | function () <br><br>This method loads the pubsubviewer widget which attaches to our upper right corner triangle menu and generates 3 menu items likePubsub Viewer, View Standalone, and Fork Widget. It also enablesthe modal dialog that shows the documentation for this widget.<br><br>By using chilipeppr.load() we can ensure that the pubsubviewer widgetis only loaded and inlined once into the final ChiliPeppr workspace.We are given back a reference to the instantiated singleton so itsnot instantiated more than once. Then we call it's attachTo methodwhich creates the full pulldown menu for us and attaches the clickevents. |


## About ChiliPeppr

[ChiliPeppr](http://chilipeppr.com) is a hardware fiddle, meaning it is a 
website that lets you easily
create a workspace to fiddle with your hardware from software. ChiliPeppr provides
a [Serial Port JSON Server](https://github.com/johnlauer/serial-port-json-server) 
that you run locally on your computer, or remotely on another computer, to connect to 
the serial port of your hardware like an Arduino or other microcontroller.

You then create a workspace at ChiliPeppr.com that connects to your hardware 
by starting from scratch or forking somebody else's
workspace that is close to what you are after. Then you write widgets in
Javascript that interact with your hardware by forking the base template 
widget or forking another widget that
is similar to what you are trying to build.

ChiliPeppr is massively capable such that the workspaces for 
[TinyG](http://chilipeppr.com/tinyg) and [Grbl](http://chilipeppr.com/grbl) CNC 
controllers have become full-fledged CNC machine management software used by
tens of thousands.

ChiliPeppr has inspired many people in the hardware/software world to use the
browser and Javascript as the foundation for interacting with hardware. The
Arduino team in Italy caught wind of ChiliPeppr and now
ChiliPeppr's Serial Port JSON Server is the basis for the 
[Arduino's new web IDE](https://create.arduino.cc/). If the Arduino team is excited about building on top
of ChiliPeppr, what
will you build on top of it?
